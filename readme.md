### This is a simple and customisable ruler holder for gridfinity in a 3x1 format.

 

Before I created this, I downloaded and printed: https://www.printables.com/model/841649-ruler-crib-gridfinity

which is shown in my pics. My model is maked ‘this model’. Now, I liked the model and I liked that the f3d file was included. But after printing I noticed the back of the ruler holder overhangs the base. For many people I guess this isn't an issue, but I wasn't keen on it and decided to edit the f3d file. Which is where I ran into an issue… it wasn't a simple case of new sketch on the side, then extrusion cut the top off and make my own. Nope, fusion threw an error when trying that. So I went on here and found a customisable blank: https://www.printables.com/model/498675-gridfinity-parametric-box-blank-fusion-360

Excellent, I thought…. and ran straight into Autodesks f.u to hobbyists. No longer can you use the customiser under a hobby licence. The moving goalposts is the reason I stopped using fusion in the first place. Plus I'm a forklift operator, how much money for a subscription do they think I have heh. Anyway….. 

Instead I went to kennetek's gridfinity-rebuilt: https://kennetek.github.io/gridfinity-rebuilt-openscad/

and used that as a basis, by creating a box, then removing everything I didn't need until I had a base. After that I created the 4 slanted parts and put them wholly within the grid area.

In total, it is a remix of kennetek's gridfinity boxes, while being inspired by akak's ruler holder.

there are some mistakes in the code, but it worked and I got the 
design I wanted out of it ;)
